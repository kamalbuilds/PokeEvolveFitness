Now evolve your Fav Pokemon Character in 21 Days along with you.
## Objectives

---

- This Decentralized application is an interesting and innovative concept that combines the use of 3D non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with physical exercise.
- We all know that it is hard to make a good habit of doing physical exercise daily unless we feel of achieving something.
- This DApp provides users with an engaging and interactive way to track and incentivize their physical activity. The use of 3D NFTs could add an additional layer of appeal and collectibility to their experience.

## Problem it solves

---

1. Lack of motivation or engagement for physical exercise: By incorporating Pokemon characters and elements of gamification into the DApp, users may be more motivated to participate in physical exercise and track their progress.
2. Difficulty tracking and verifying physical activity: By using technologies like wearable fitness trackers or mobile apps, our DApp could provide users with a convenient and accurate way to track their physical activity and exercise routines.
3. Limited options for tracking and rewarding physical activity: By using a blockchain-based platform and NFTs, our DApp could provide users with a new and innovative way to track and reward their physical activity.

## Why this project?

1. In the recent times due to coming of Covid , dibetis , heart attack and tons of healthcare problems. We all have felt the need of doing exercises daily but being consistent can be a huge problem . It takes at least 21 days to form a good habit and this dapp would evolve the users fav pokemon character along with evolving them and giving them a good habit over time.
